> A curated list of awesome blogs, resources and tutorials for learning Shiny for Python.

[Shiny for Python](https://shiny.posit.co/py/) is an open source Python package that provides an elegant and powerful web framework for building web applications using Python. Shiny helps you turn your analyses into interactive web applications without requiring HTML, CSS, or JavaScript knowledge.

Shiny is a framework that makes it easy to build interactive web applications without requiring traditional web development skills. Since its introduction ten years ago for R, Shiny has made it possible for R users to communicate with a much broader audienceâ€”and now Shiny is available for Python! Python users can now use Shiny to create interactive data-driven web applications by writing Python code.
